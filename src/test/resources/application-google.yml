# You can use this google profile, if the field service is running against google IDP
# and it you are running locally.
#
# The reason why you must be running locally is because on the kubernetes environment 
# you will get a Captcha which will fail the cucumber tests.
#
# An example of running with this profile locally:
#
#   export CONFIG_PASSWORD=<the password for the user-id below>
#
#   mvn clean install -Dspring.profiles.active=google
#

config:
  idp-type: google
  user-id: fieldservice_test@test.field.census.gov.uk
  password: override_me_with_runtime_property
